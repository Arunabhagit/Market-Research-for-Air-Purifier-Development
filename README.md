# Market Fit Analysis for Air Purifier Development Using AQI and Health Impact Insights

# Introduction

This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive market fit analysis for the development of an innovative air purifier, tailored to India’s worsening air quality crisis. Using AQI data (2022–2025) alongside health impact, population, and EV adoption datasets, the study identifies key pollutants, high-risk cities, and consumer demand triggers. It also examines the correlation between pollution levels and health outcomes, and how these influence purchasing behavior. The insights are visualized through an interactive dashboard, enabling top-level management to make data-driven decisions on product features, target markets, and pricing strategies—ensuring the air purifier is both effective and aligned with market needs.

# Object 

The objective of this project is to evaluate the market potential for a new air purifier in India by integrating environmental, health, and demographic data. Specifically, it aims to:

- Identify cities and regions with the highest and most persistent air pollution levels.

- Analyze the correlation between air quality and pollution-related health outcomes.

- Determine key pollutants and essential product features for targeted filtration.

- Assess consumer demand triggers based on pollution spikes and market trends.

- Provide actionable insights through an interactive dashboard to guide product design, pricing, and marketing strategies for optimal market fit.
