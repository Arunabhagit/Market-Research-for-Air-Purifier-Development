# Market Fit Analysis for Air Purifier Development Using AQI and Health Impact Insights

# Introduction

This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive market fit analysis for the development of an innovative air purifier, tailored to India’s worsening air quality crisis. Using AQI data (2022–2025) alongside health impact, population, and EV adoption datasets, the study identifies key pollutants, high-risk cities, and consumer demand triggers. It also examines the correlation between pollution levels and health outcomes, and how these influence purchasing behavior. The insights are visualized through an interactive dashboard, enabling top-level management to make data-driven decisions on product features, target markets, and pricing strategies—ensuring the air purifier is both effective and aligned with market needs.
